> **Notes:**
> - **Rinvex University** is framework-agnostic, so it's compatible with any PHP framework whatsoever without any dependencies at all, except for the PHP version itself **^8.0.0**. Awesome, huh? :smiley:
> - **Rinvex University** provides the global helpers for your convenience and for ease of use, but in fact it's just wrappers around the underlying `UniversityLoader` class, which you can utilize and use directly if you wish
